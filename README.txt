File Structure:

1)
Please compile and run from root folder (lab1-inventory-tracker-rod-gaitan )using commands:

$ tsc

$ node src/main.js

2)
Please see basic file structure:

lab1-inventory-tracker-rod-gaitan/
├── src/
│   ├── models/
│   │   ├── Product.ts
│   │   ├── Physical Product.ts
│   │   └── DigitalProduct.ts
|    |	 |--- DiscountableProduct.ts
│   ├── utils/
│   │   └── taxCalculator.ts
|    |	 |--- productSorter.ts
│   └── main.ts
└── tsconfig.json

3) 
Note:
- I was skeptical of removing all .js files, because it became apparent that the main.js was needed.
- I was a bit confused between the file structure given on the instructions at #7 where it asked to run node dist/main.js, bc the graph shows to have src/main.ts.
